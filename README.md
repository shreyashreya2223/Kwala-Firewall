# Kwala-Firewall

Kwala Firewall is a hackathon project developed by our team of four with the aim of building a safer environment for users in the Web3 ecosystem. As decentralized technologies grow rapidly, security risks such as phishing attacks, scam transactions, and malicious wallet activity are becoming increasingly common. This project was created to tackle these challenges by providing a security layer that detects and alerts users of suspicious activities in real time.

Overview

Kwala Firewall acts as a monitoring and alerting system for crypto wallets. It leverages Kwala APIs and tools to track wallet interactions continuously, analyzing transaction behavior and flagging anything that appears abnormal or potentially harmful. The goal is to provide users with timely alerts that help them avoid scams or fraudulent activities before they cause damage.

This solution is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate into existing Web3 applications and wallets, making it accessible to both developers and everyday users.

Key Features

Real-time Monitoring: Keeps track of wallet activities as they happen.

Phishing & Scam Detection: Identifies suspicious transactions, malicious addresses, and possible fraud.

Instant Alerts: Notifies users immediately when suspicious activity is detected.

Seamless Integration: Can be easily added to Web3 applications and wallets with minimal setup.

User Safety: Empowers individuals and organizations to interact more securely in decentralized ecosystems.

Motivation

The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 platforms has created exciting opportunities but also significant risks. New users often fall victim to scams, fake links, and malicious contracts, losing valuable assets. Kwala Firewall was designed during a hackathon as a proactive solution to reduce these risks.

Our vision was to build a tool that not only addresses the security gaps in blockchain interactions but also promotes trust and confidence in Web3 technologies.

Team Members

This project was created during a hackathon by a passionate team of four:

Ronak Thakur

Neeraj Upadhayay

Anjlika Anand

Shreya

Each team member contributed their skills in blockchain, security, and software development, working collaboratively under time constraints to bring this idea to life.

Future Scope

While the current version of Kwala Firewall demonstrates the concept of real-time wallet monitoring and alerts, we envision expanding it into a more comprehensive Web3 security framework. Potential future directions include:

Building advanced machine learning models for detecting scam patterns.

Adding multi-wallet monitoring with user-friendly dashboards.

Offering browser extensions and mobile app integration for everyday users.

Partnering with Web3 platforms to provide built-in wallet protection.

Installation & Usage (Future Implementation)

This section will include steps for installation and usage once the system is fully developed. For now, the prototype demonstrates:

Connecting to Kwala APIs.

Monitoring a target wallet address.

Generating alerts for suspicious activities.
