# Kwala-Firewall
Kwala Firewall is a hackathon project built by our team of four to enhance Web3 security. It monitors wallet activity in real time, detects phishing and scam transactions, and alerts users of suspicious activity. Designed with Kwala APIs, it offers a lightweight, easy-to-integrate solution for safer decentralized interactions.
